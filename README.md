# Covid-Non-Covid-Visualization-With-Histogram-Oriented-Gradient-Features-
This is a python code for analyzing positive and negative CT Scan images of Human lung Histogram oriented gradients Feature and visualisation.  This can be used for training Machine learning Model for classifying coronavirus  positive and  coronavirus negative  Human laung.  Not only featured images using This algorithm,  this code I will give you a full data set consisting of Histogram oriented gradient features of each image. You will get a matrix containing the histogram oriented gradients pattern visualization  of all the images together .
